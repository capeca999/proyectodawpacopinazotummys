		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Adoptar a un animal es un acto del que debes estar muy seguro. Con suerte durará muchos años y durante éste tiempo necesitará atención veterinaria, alimento, camitas, pensar en él para ir de viaje, sacarlo a pasear dirariamente varias veces...
        Si estás totalmente convencido, adelante con la adopción!! Es una experiencia maravillosa, aprenderás mucho de él y en la mayoria de los casos habrás salvado una vida. Para formalizar la adopción deberemos seguir los siguientes pasos.</p>
        <h4>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h4>
        <p>El primer paso para la adopción de una animal de La Perrita Valiente es rellenar el cuestionario pre-adopción. En este cuestionario que te enviaremos vía e-mail, podemos conocerte un poco más, saber qué tipo de perro estás buscando y ayudarte en la elección para que sea la más satisfactoria para todos. En ocasiones buscamos un perro tan solo por cómo es por fuera, cuando lo más importante es que tanto adoptante como adoptado convivan felizmente.</p><br>
